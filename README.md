# my implementation of "John Conway's Game of Life"
---
please don't expect very much from it. it's my first project in c and code is garbage to say the least, also it runs like garbage :)

controls:
- space - step and Pause
- LMB (held) - move around
- RMB - invert tile
- mouse wheel - zoom in/out
- 1/2/3/4 - change speeds
- c - clear
- r - random

build:
  should build everywhere, as long as you have raylib installed, but i don't really know
